      <h2>A short biography</h2>
    
      <p>My name is Ryan LeDuc. I work on the grant funded ARISE Project at CVTC.</p>

        When I was four years old, I traveled to Mount Kilimanjaro with my Ama and her guru. In those days, 
        you could walk right up to the edge of the abyss, and if you were brave, lean out just far enough to 
        see past the edge of space and time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stories say the 'verse used to glow bright, hot and white, and you would be lucky to come back with 
        even half your eyesight intact. But the first and last time I saw the light of the 'verse, it was a 
        shade of teal so dim I could barely see it reflected in my Ama's eyes as I fell away into the abyss.
      </p>
      <p>And that's how I got here.</p>
      <p>
        These days I'm a programming student. When I'm not in school, I work on the grant funded ARISE Project, 
        helping to program simulations used in CVTC and other tech college health programs. I'm also a bit 
        of a gym rat and enjoy long distance running.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm still searching for the edge of the abyss on this side of the 'verse. If you find it, or know 
        where it is, let me know.
